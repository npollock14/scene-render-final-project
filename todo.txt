General functions I will need:

each object in the scene must be:
loaded
configured
updated
rendered


first we have an init method:

init(){
    load object data into memory
    configure basic settings
    load buffers

    //calls render at the end
    render();
}

will have one render method that is the animation loop:

render(){
    for each object in scene:
        render object;


    requestAnimationFrame(render);
}

object render method - implemented per object
    configure flags for the vertex/frag shaders
    set active
    render
